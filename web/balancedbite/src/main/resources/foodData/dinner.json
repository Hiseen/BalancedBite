Defrosting items in the fridge overnight may be the best and easiest way to ensure they are ready to use, but what if you haven't planned ahead? The microwave is the fastest option, but can be uneven and affect the texture. We prefer this quick-defrost method, which is ideal for thinner ingredients and things like soups that have been frozen flat in resealable plastic bags: Make sure the food is sealed airtight, cover it with cold water in a bowl or pot, and submerge it with a plate or some such. Change the water every 30 minutes until the item is defrosted; breaking up pieces of fish or meat when they are soft enough will speed the process.

I spent some time searching for the perfect Chili recipe, and I definitely found it with this one.  I did make some modifications as I was making it.  I used 1.5lbs of Medium Ground beef, which I fried up separately to season and ensure there wasn't a lot of fat transferred into the chili.  I also used 2 cans of beans, and for that 3rd can, swapped in a cup of corn for texture and appearance and for the 2 cans of beans used 1 Kidney and 1 Black beans.   After cooking for a little bit, I found it thickened up very quickly, so I poured in a cup and a half of water to loosen things up, as it cooks down it finds its way back to a great not-too thick chili.  All in all, It turned out exceptionally well, and it's not overly spicy out of the pot (which my wife enjoys) but I drizzle over some sriracha to kick up the heat.

I used chicken broth instead of water in the sauce, and instead of hot sauce I used maeploy, probably about a half a cup or more of it.  I sauteed my onions with fresh garlic before mixing them into the ground beef.  I also added some ketchup to the meat.  I wanted to ad an egg but wanted to stay  with the basic makeup of this recipe to see if it worked.  I put it in a crockpot.  My problem was that the majority of the meatballs fell apart, which I feel would have also happened if I had baked this in the oven for the recommended amount of time.  In making it in the future I would prebake the meatballs on a sheet tray and then put them in the crock pot with the sauce.  Also, I will ad an egg to the meatballs and some breadcrumbs or extra rice.  The sauce was very bland and needing much work done to it to make it edible.

Tear bread into pieces and process in a food processor until coarse crumbs form. To make fine breadcrumbs, process until very fine. To make dry breadcrumbs, spread coarse or fine breadcrumbs on a baking sheet and bake at 250\u00b0F until dry, about 10 to 15 minutes. One slice of bread makes about \u00bd cup fresh breadcrumbs or about \u2153 cup dry breadcrumbs.

Paprika specifically labeled Hungarian delivers a fuller, richer flavor than regular paprika. Smoked paprika is made from smoke-dried red peppers and adds earthy, smoky flavor. It can be used in many types of savory dishes. Look for different types of paprika at some large supermarkets or at tienda.com or penzeys.com.\nEasy cleanup: Recipes that require cooking spray can leave behind a sticky residue that can be hard to clean. To save time and keep your baking sheet looking fresh, line it with a layer of foil before you apply the cooking spray.\nStorage smarts: For long-term freezer storage, wrap your food in a layer of plastic wrap followed by a layer of foil.

Be sure to wash your hands thoroughly after handling hot peppers or wear rubber gloves. If you can't find Scotch bonnet peppers, habaneros can be substituted.\nCut Down on Dishes: A rimmed baking sheet is great for everything from roasting to catching accidental drips and spills. For effortless cleanup and to keep your baking sheets in tip-top shape, line them with a layer of foil before each use.\nStorage smarts: For long-term freezer storage, wrap your food in a layer of plastic wrap followed by a layer of foil.

When I'm in the mood, I also toss in some golden raisins (about 1/4 c) which adds a nice additional level of flavor. I cook up a pot of brown basmati rice while I'm prepping the dal dish. When the rice is done, I add about 3 c. to the lentil mango mix, so I wind up with an Indian Mango Dal Stew. It's fabulous on its own, but you can knock it out of the park by passing around some Mango Chutney. This pairs nicely with a light salad.

I did the following: 1) went out to my garden and cut enough fresh rosemary to coat the bottom of my half sheet pan (I have a big plant), 2) rinsed & dried the chicken 3) Rubbed kosher salt all over the chicken pieces, 4) coated chicken with olive oil 5) coated the chicken which the pre-made Jamaican jerk rub, 5) placed the chicken on top of the rosemary in the pan, 6) poured a can of beer into the shallow half sheet pan.  7) Put it in the oven at 450oF for 10 min, 8) dropped the temp to 325oF and cooked it for another hour.  I just took it out and tasted it and it is great!  The rosemary flavor is strong, so if you don't like rosemary this isn't for you.

Spread the coals in an even layer. Place a grate over the coals. Let the coals burn until they are about medium-low. (Grill any toppings for the pizza while the coals are burning down.) To test the heat, hold your palm about 5 inches above the grill rack; if you can hold it there for about 8 seconds before you need to move it away, the fire is medium-low. Transfer the crust to the grill rack, cover the grill and cook the crust, checking once or twice, until lightly browned, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip the crust, quickly add the toppings, cover the grill and cook until the toppings are hot and the bottom of the crust has browned, 5 to 8 minutes. If your crust browns faster than your toppings are cooking, slide a baking sheet under the pizza to keep the crust from burning while the toppings finish.\nPizza in the oven: Place a pizza stone on the lowest rack; preheat oven to 450\u00b0F for at least 20 minutes. Roll out the dough and place on a cornmeal-dusted pizza peel or inverted baking sheet, using enough cornmeal so that the dough slides easily. Slide the dough onto the preheated stone and cook until the bottom begins to crisp, about 3 minutes. Remove the crust from the oven using a large spatula and place it uncooked-side down on the peel or baking sheet, making sure the underside of the crust is completely coated with cornmeal. Quickly add the toppings and slide the pizza back onto the stone. Continue baking until the toppings are hot and the bottom of the crust has browned, 12 to 15 minutes.\nIndividual variation: \nThe dough can be turned into 4 or 6 personal-size pizzas.
