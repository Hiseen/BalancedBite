With the apples and raisins there is really no need for any additional flavoring of syrup, whipped cream, etc. The only negative is that with the whole-wheat bread, the coloring of the dish turns out a little drab/gray (refer to the photo accompanying the recipe itself and you can see this --sorry, I didn't think to take a picture of mine).
