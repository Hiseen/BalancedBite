If you have access to fresh grape leaves, you could harvest your own to use instead.

Don't confuse bulgur with cracked wheat, which is just that\u0097cracked wheat. Since the parboiling step is skipped, cracked wheat must be cooked for up to an hour whereas bulgur simply needs a quick soak in hot water for most uses.
