# BalancedBite
## Introduction
In modern society, many people struggle in having healthy, balanced meals. For
instance, children love snacks and ice cream because they are sweet and
flavorful, students love instant noodles and fast food because they are
convenient, and dieters love eating little to lose weights.
  
Studies have shown that unhealthy eating can lead to severe conditions such as
nutrient deficiencies or diabetes.
  
BalancedBite provides multiple suggestions of dishes to the users based on their
personal health status, preferences, and social standings (Ex: student).
  
It also provides alternatives to usersâ€™ current preference to help them start
eating healthily.
